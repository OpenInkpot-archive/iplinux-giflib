#
# This is the make file for the util subdirectory of the GIF library
# In order to run it tcc is assumed to be available, in addition to
# tlib and borland make.
#
# Usage: "make [-DMDL=model]" where model can be l (large) or c (compact) etc.
# Note the MDL is optional with large model as default.
#
#
# This make file requires:
# 1. Setting the TC libraries directory as CC_LIBS below. Make sure this
#    is really short (because of DOS stupid limit on command line length).
# 2. Setting the executables destination directory as DEST below. Make
#    sure that directory do exists.
# 2. Making new library named graphbgi.lib holds the drivers for the different
#    devices (using bgiobj.exe and tlib.exe utilities).
